      <p>Feeling rejuvenated and charged with purpose and possibility after attending (and staffing) the <a href="https://conference.pact.ca/">PACT conference</a> last week. Cannot believe how many artistic people I met! So lucky. Feeling like I have a much better idea of the organization’s place (and my place) in the sector, and some new ideas about approaches I can take to my work.</p>

<p>A few highlights were:</p>

<h3 id="the-session-on-theatre-in-a-digital-world">The session on theatre in a digital world.</h3>

<p>We were so fortunate to hear Dustin Harvey and Sarah Garton Stanley articulate the questions and ideas the digital poses in their artistic practices:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>For Dustin, investigating intimacy and immediacy in digital spaces.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For Sarah, the idea of the hologram - <em>What are the implications for live performance when I can no longer discern if the performer is physically in the room with me?</em></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We also had some excellent discussion on how we might take a closer look at the open source software development pipeline as a model - in a somewhat abstract way for artistic creation, and in a more literal way for how theatres might collectively (re)create and maintain the tools the industry relies on.</p>

<h3 id="the-unofficial-interns-and-associates-luncheon">The <em>unofficial</em> interns and associates luncheon.</h3>

<p>Keltie Forsyth, Associate Artistic Director at Pi Theatre facilitated a gathering of interns, associates, assistants, coordinators, etc., to network and discuss our experiences in the industry and items of mutual concern.</p>

<p>The main focus of discussion was the precarity faced by the majority of our group - which also happened to be made up of the youngest conference attendees. (What a coincidence!)</p>

<p>How do you continue to participate in the most pressing conversations in our sector <em>(ahem - let’s start with decolonization, accessibility, equity)</em> when you’re uncertain if you’ll be able to attend next year’s conference? Or when you’re uncertain if there will be any work for you in the industry? No answers yet. Keltie and I are going to try to make sure a longer session makes it into the official schedule next year.</p>

<h3 id="meeting-so-many-people">Meeting <em>so many</em> people.</h3>

<p>Here are just a few of the artistic people I was lucky enough to meet for the first time and hang out with in various capacities:</p>

<p>Nina Lee Aquino, Keith Barker, Sarah Garton Stanley, Dustin Harvey, Jacob Zimmer, Beth Brown, Jenna Marie Schwartz, Laurel Green, Brittany Ryan, Brian Quirt, Vikki Anderson, Nancy Webster, Bonnie Green, Mike Payette. And more! So many more!</p>

<h3 id="eating-things">Eating things</h3>
<p>I ate lots of mussels, and a lobster too. Cows ice cream. Solid trip.</p>
