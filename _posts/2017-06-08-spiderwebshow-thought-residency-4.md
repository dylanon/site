Hey, it's Dylan again. Thought #4 is about sharing, artistic labour, and money.

I'll be among the first to advocate for more openness, more sharing of artistic works, the ability to build upon them... I think that if art is a public good it should be freely available.

However, I have to wonder if sharing freely in this way undervalues - devalues artistic labour in an industry that already has problems being undervalued socially and with actual dollars.
