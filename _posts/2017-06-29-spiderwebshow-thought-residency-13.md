My last thought:

"If you can picture yourself doing anything else, don't go into theatre."

I think this is such a damaging thing to say to our young people. It instills this nagging worry that maybe we don't love our art enough, and maybe we don't belong here.

So, I just want to say - To other young people who are just starting their careers: We do belong here, and all we have to focus on is if theatre is loving us back enough in return.

Thank you.
