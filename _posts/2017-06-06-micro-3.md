And here is a test post to see if IFTTT can cross-post a long microblog from [my blog](https://dylanon.com/blog/) to Twitter. 
Testing 1 2 3! To be or not to be, that is the question. Micro.blog has a 280 character limit, so how does that jive with Twiter's 
140 characters? I'm hoping this will get truncated somehow.
