Glad I caught the late show of [Now What Theatre's](https://nowwhattheatre.com/) [*Kara Sevda*](https://fringetoronto.com/festivals/fringe/event/kara-sevda) - Refreshing to see an apocalypse play with a human focus. Too often plays dealing with the end of the world become every dystopian Hollywood film I've ever seen - But not this one. I dig it!
