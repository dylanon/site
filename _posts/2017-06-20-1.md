Using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) to build and deploy this blog now, and it's working really well. All part of my iOS posting scheme - If I can find the right (ahem, free) app to push commits up to Github, then Travis will take care of the rest. Looks like my best bet might be to grab [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/) for $21.
