[Mind of a Snail&#39;s *Multiple Organism*](https://fringetoronto.com/festivals/fringe/event/multiple-organism) is half low-tech projection magic, half expert clowning. One of those rare performances that leaves you in genuine awe of the way artistry, craft, and innovation come together. Last show is tomorrow at 5:15pm. See it!
