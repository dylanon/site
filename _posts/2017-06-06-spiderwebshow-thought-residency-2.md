Hey, it’s Dylan and this is my second thought.

Today I’m thinking about [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/), so for example, the process that governs our move from version 1 to version 2. In software, this is a huge shift introducing backwards-incompatible changes that mean you can’t use that software in the same way.

We can re-invent *Romeo & Juliet* into version 2 and demand a fundamentally different engagement with that work, but the important question is: How do we get to version 3 from there, and how far can we go?
