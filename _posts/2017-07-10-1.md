Made my first circuits with Arduino last night. I didn't find the electricity unit in science class very interesting - but I would have if it integrated rudimentary computing the way working with this little microcontroller does. Finding [this eBook by one of the project co-founders Massimo Banzi](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5301125-getting-started-with-arduino) really helpful. Lots to learn, but this could be start of some engaging artistic experiments.
