Deposit paid and raring to go - I'm taking my career in a new direction.

I've been exploring coding over the past 5+ years, and for the past two years have been taking on some freelance projects making things on the web (often in the dead of night).

Recently realized that I love to create and problem solve in this way, and that there is no time like the present to pursue what makes you happy.

Can't wait to formalize my skills as a Web Developer at [HackerYou](http://hackeryou.com/) in October!
