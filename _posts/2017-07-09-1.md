The Toronto Reference Library is overflowing with creative energy for [Maker Festival](http://makerfestival.ca/) this weekend. I stumbled upon it yesterday and walked around in awe. I was feeling inspired, so I picked up the [Arduino Starter Kit](https://elmwoodelectronics.ca/collections/arduino/products/arduino-starter-kit) to start exploring physical computing.
