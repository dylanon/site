In 1979, the Canadian government welcomed my family here - Refugees from a camp in Hong Kong, fleeing persecution in the wake of the Vietnam War. We are grateful for this. But we were brought here by settlers, colonizers, onto Indigenous land. We have a responsibility to [educate ourselves and support Indigenous peoples in reclaiming their rights](http://unsettling150.ca/). Doing my best to listen and learn, and trying to do better.
