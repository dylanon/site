I always thought macOS had git pre-installed - If you're seeing 
<span style="word-wrap: break-word;">`xcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools), missing xcrun at: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun`</span>,
run `xcode-select --install` to [install Command Line Tools](http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/).
