Wowed by the performance boost from [replacing my hard disk drive](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Unibody+Model+A1342+Hard+Drive+Replacement/1670) with a [solid state drive](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01IAGSD68/). Definitely worth it. Sad to see that newer models no longer have drives that are user-replaceable. Let's get this 2010 Macbook (think white plastic) to its 10th birthday!
