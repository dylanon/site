Huge turnout last night for [Potluck XIV](http://theatrecentre.org/?p=10521) at The Theatre Centre. So impressed see the resources [fu-GEN](http://fu-gen.org/) consistently devotes to helping Asian Canadian creators develop new work. It's important. And the value to the community is apparent. (Also the food is always unbelievable.)
