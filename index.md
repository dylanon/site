Hi. My name is Dylan On.

I'm passionate about performance and tech. I'm an arts administrator by day and
a web designer by night. I'm a self-taught coder, occasional theatre producer,
and more frequent theatre tweeter. Read [my blog](#) or check out some quick thoughts
on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dylanon).

Need a site, or a code monkey for your next project? [E-mail me](#) - let's make it happen!
