<p>
	I'm passionate about <strong>performance and tech</strong>. I'm an arts administrator by day and
	a web designer by night - a self-taught coder, occasional theatre producer,
	and more frequent theatre tweeter.

<p>
	I'll have a blog here soon. Until then, follow my up-to-the-minute thoughts on <a href="https://twitter.com/dylanon">Twitter</a>.
