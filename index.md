<p class="h1">Hi. My name is Dylan On.</p>

I'm passionate about **performance and tech**. I'm an arts administrator by day and
a web designer by night - a self-taught coder, occasional theatre producer,
and more frequent theatre tweeter. 

I'll have a blog here soon. Until then, follow my up-to-the-minute thoughts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dylanon).
